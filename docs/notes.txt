no keywords at all, just symbols for each statement
line-based, like VBScript
whitespace-insensitive, unlike Python
statement based, like C
no user data types, but you can use the index dictionary type
no semicolons, but you have to close block statements with a curly brace

a value can only be assigned to new values of the same type as declared or first assigned to a non-null value

You can only call functions already loaded from another script
or functions declared in this script...
...not functions in some unknown later script
