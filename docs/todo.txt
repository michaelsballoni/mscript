Port mscript to c++

import statement to glue scripts together
	use + symbol, makes sense to add in script
	script_exception needs filename
	allow names to have .'s in them, poor man's namespaces
		have "member function" lookup look from *last* dot in symbol, before that is the variable name

runtime:
add input function, getline sort of thing
add system => exec
add popen  => process
add file I/O, read + write
the rest can be done with system and popen and expressions like split

mscript.exe project
	set cmd line parameters as an object::list into the initial symbol table, call it arguments
