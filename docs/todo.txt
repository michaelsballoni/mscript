Port mscript to c++
mscript-core:	port code and unit tests and get to pass as you go
	Expression
		bring over QA tests that cover expression pretty well
	ScriptProcessor
		bring over the script file testing system, get all tests to pass

object: turns lists and indexes in shared_ptrs to not be copying all over the place
object/expression: clone function, deep recursive clone

add system function as a global function

mscript.exe project
	incorporate 4db

import statement { filename } to glue scripts together
	allow names to have .'s in them, poor man's namespaces
