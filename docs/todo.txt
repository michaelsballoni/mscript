Port mscript to c++
mscript-core:	port code and unit tests and get to pass as you go
	ScriptProcessor
		add test for new regex getMatches function

object/expression:
clone function, deep recursive clone
	add unit test
	add script test

runtime:
add input function, getline sort of thing
add system => exec
add popen  => process
add file I/O, read + write
the rest can be done with system and popen and expressions like split

import statement to glue scripts together
	use + symbol, makes sense to add in script
	script_exception needs filename
	allow names to have .'s in them, poor man's namespaces
		have "member function" lookup look from *last* dot in symbol, before that is the variable name

create new set of test scripts, more of that "Should be..." stuff

why is fibonacci so slow?

mscript.exe project
	set cmd line parameters as an object::list into the initial symbol table, call it arguments
