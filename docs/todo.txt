Port mscript to c++

runtime:
add input function, getline sort of thing
	- test
add file I/O, read + write
	readFile(path, [encoding])
	writeFile(path, text, [encoding])

import statement, part deux
	track the full path of each filename, and make imports relative to the full paths of the script being inserted
	allow names to have .'s in them, poor man's namespaces
		have "member function" lookup look from *last* dot in symbol, before that is the variable name

mscript.exe project
	set cmd line parameters as an object::list into the initial symbol table, call it arguments
