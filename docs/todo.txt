Port mscript to c++
mscript-core:	port code and unit tests and get to pass as you go
	ScriptProcessor
		bring over the script file testing system, get all tests to pass
		add test for new regex getMatches function

object/expression:
clone function, deep recursive clone

runtime:
add system => exec
add popen  => process
add file I/O, read + write
the rest can be done with system and popen and expressions like split

import statement to glue scripts together
	use + symbol, makes sense to add in script
	script_exception needs filename
	allow names to have .'s in them, poor man's namespaces
		have "member function" lookup look from *last* dot in symbol, before that is the variable name

mscript.exe project
	set cmd line parameters as an object::list into the initial symbol table, call it arguments
